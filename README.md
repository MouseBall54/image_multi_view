## üåê Live Demo

Experience CompareX directly in your browser: **[https://mouseball54.github.io/image_multi_view/](https://mouseball54.github.io/image_multi_view/)**

No installation required - all processing happens locally in your browser!

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîí Privacy-First Design
- **100% Client-Side Processing** - No file uploads, all processing happens locally
- **Complete Privacy** - Your images never leave your device
- **No Server Required** - Pure web application with offline capability

### üéØ Four Specialized Viewing Modes
1. **Single Mode** - Focused single-view with unified file list
2. **Compare Mode** - Side-by-side comparison of multiple folders
3. **Pinpoint Mode** - Precision alignment with reference points and rotation
4. **Analysis Mode** - Advanced filter application and comparison

### üñºÔ∏è Advanced Image Support
- **Standard Formats**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP
- **TIFF Support**: Full TIFF decoding with UTIF library
- **Large Image Handling**: Efficient bitmap caching and memory management
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant preview of all operations

### üé® Professional Filter System
- **60+ Advanced Filters**: From basic adjustments to complex OpenCV operations
- **Filter Chains**: Combine multiple filters in custom sequences with sequential labeling
- **Real-time Preview**: See changes instantly as you adjust parameters
- **Filter Preview System**: Preview filters before applying with side-by-side comparison
- **Smart Filter Labels**: Dynamic filter chain display (e.g., "Gaussian Blur ‚Üí Sharpen ‚Üí Canny")
- **Export Capabilities**: Save filter settings and apply to multiple images

### ‚ö° High-Performance Interface
- **Flexible Layouts**: Auto-grid and completely free positioning modes with drag & resize
- **Synchronized Navigation**: Pan and zoom across all viewers simultaneously
- **Smart UI Controls**: Toggle buttons for folders, files, and filter labels visibility
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Extensive hotkey support for rapid workflow
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

## üîÑ Recent Highlights

- Pinpoint reordering refined: viewer slots (A, B, C, ‚Ä¶) stay fixed while you drag to reorder images. Image-follow transforms ensure per-image zoom, rotation, and filters move with the image.
- Shift vs Swap: choose how drag reordering behaves. Toggle lives in the header and shows active state (blue) like Minimap/Grid.
- Leveling tools: horizontal and vertical auto-level. Click the button, then click two points; a blue crosshair follows the cursor, the first click is fixed, and the second click computes the angle to align. Applies per-viewer in Pinpoint, and as global rotation in Compare/Analysis.
- Pinpoint Global Scale input: enter a % directly in the header. Arrow controls removed and input is compact; values are safely clamped to avoid over-zoom.
- Layout polish: viewer canvas fills the entire grid cell reliably in all layouts; removed old hover hints that could cause scrollbars and tiny size shifts.
- New filters: Brightness and Contrast (Tone & Basics). Integrated everywhere (preview, chains, export) with compact controls.
- Preview editor integration: the preview panel now embeds the same filter editor (type + params) used elsewhere. Changes reflect immediately in the preview and update the chain step you‚Äôre editing.
